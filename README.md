# GitHub Actions Deploy Pipeline
The [main.yml](./.github/workflows/main.yml) script which defines the documentation build pipeline. To get this to work, 
you might have to change the permissions allocated to the GitHub Actions runner on a per-repository level. This can be 
found in (Repository Settings > Code and Automation > Actions > General > Workflow Permissions > enable `Read and write permissions`)
